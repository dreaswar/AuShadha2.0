# AuShadha2.0

Introduction
============
Repository for AuShadha Electronic Medical Records 


Why AuShadha2.0
================
AuShadha is the second version , a complete rewrite of AuShadha1.0 EMR at https://github.com/dreaswar/AuShadha.git. 
The ground up rewrite was necessitated by changes in versions of Django which are backward compatibility breaking
and also the move to Python3.x.

AuShadha2.0 will support Django>1.10 and Python3.x. It was thought that it is better to create a separate Repo for 
AuShadha2.0 rather than a branch at the original repository. 

Dojo 1.1x will be used as the JS library. 

Dojo 2.x is a complete rewrite and is not planned now for integration into AuShadha2.0
