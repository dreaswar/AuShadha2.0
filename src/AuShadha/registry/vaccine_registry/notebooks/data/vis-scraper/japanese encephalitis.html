 <p>
  Japanese encephalitis (JE) is a serious infection caused by the Japanese encephalitis virus.
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   It occurs mainly in rural parts of Asia.
  </li>
  <li>
   It is spread through the bite of an infected mosquito. It does not spread from person to person.
  </li>
  <li>
   Risk is very low for most travelers. It is higher for people living in areas where the disease is common, or for people traveling there for long periods of time.
  </li>
  <li>
   Most people infected with JE virus donât have any symptoms.  Others might have symptoms as mild as a fever and headache, or as serious as encephalitis (brain infection).
  </li>
  <li>
   A person with encephalitis can experience fever, neck stiffness, seizures, and coma.  About 1 person in 4 with encephalitis dies. Up to half of those who donât die have permanent disability.
  </li>
  <li>
   It is believed that infection in a pregnant woman could harm her unborn baby.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  JE vaccine can help protect travelers from JE disease.

  JE vaccine
 </h3>
 <p>
  Japanese encephalitis vaccine is approved for people 2 months of age and older. It is recommended for travelers to Asia who:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   plan to spend at least a month in areas where JE occurs,
  </li>
  <li>
   plan to travel for less than a month, but will visit rural areas and spend a lot of time outdoors,
  </li>
  <li>
   travel to areas where there is a JE outbreak, or
  </li>
  <li>
   are not sure of their travel plans.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Laboratory workers at risk for exposure to JE virus should also be vaccinated.
 </p>
 <p>
  The vaccine is given as a 2-dose series, with the doses spaced 28 days apart. The second dose should be given at least a week before travel. Children younger than 3 years of age get a smaller dose than patients who are 3 or older.
 </p>
 <p>
  A booster dose might be recommended for anyone 17 or older who was vaccinated more than a year ago and is still at risk of exposure. There is no information yet on the need for a booster dose for children.
 </p>
 <p>
  NOTE:
  <em>
   The best way to prevent JE is to avoid mosquito bites
  </em>
  .  Your doctor can advise you.

  Some people should not get this vaccine
 </h3>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Anyone who has had a severe (life-threatening) allergic reaction to a dose of JE vaccine should not get another dose.
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Anyone who has a severe (life threatening) allergy to any component of JE vaccine 
                	  should not get the vaccine.
   </p>
   <p>
    <em>
     Tell your doctor if you have any severe allergies that you know of
    </em>
    .
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   Pregnant women should usually not get JE vaccine. If you are pregnant, check with your doctor.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  If you will be traveling for fewer than 30 days, especially if you will be staying in urban areas, tell your doctor. You might not need the vaccine.

  Risks of a vaccine reaction
 </h3>
 <p>
  With a vaccine, like any medicine, there is a chance of side effects. When side effects happen, they are usually mild and go away on their own.
 </p>
 <h4>
  Mild problems
 </h4>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Pain, tenderness, redness, or swelling where the shot was given (about 1 person in 4).
  </li>
  <li>
   Fever (mainly in children).
  </li>
  <li>
   Headache, muscle aches (mainly in adults).
  </li>
 </ul>
 <h4>
  Moderate or Severe problems
 </h4>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Studies have shown that severe reactions to JE vaccine are very rare.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <h4>
  Problems that can happen after any vaccine
 </h4>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Brief fainting spells can happen after any medical procedure, including vaccination. Sitting or lying down for about 15 minutes can help prevent fainting, and injuries caused by a fall. Tell your doctor if you feel dizzy, or have vision changes or ringing in the ears.
  </li>
  <li>
   Lasting shoulder pain and reduced range of motion in the arm where the shot was given can happen, very rarely, after a vaccination.
  </li>
  <li>
   Severe allergic reactions from a vaccine are very rare, estimated at less than 1 in a million doses. If one were to occur, it would usually be within a few minutes to a few hours after the vaccination.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  The

   What if there is a serious reaction?
  </span>
 </h3>
 <h4>
  What should I look for?
 </h4>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Look for anything that concerns you, such as signs of a severe allergic reaction, very high fever, or behavior changes. 	Signs of a severe allergic reaction can include hives, swelling of the face and throat, difficulty breathing, a fast heartbeat, dizziness, and weakness. These would usually start a few minutes to a few hours after the vaccination.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <h4>
  What should I do?
 </h4>
 <ul>
  <li>
   If you think it is a severe allergic reaction or other emergency that canât wait, call 9-1-1 or get the person to the nearest hospital. Otherwise, call your doctor.
  </li>
  <li>
   Afterward, the reaction should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Your doctor might file this report, or you can do it yourself through the
   <a href="http://www.vaers.hhs.gov">
    VAERS website
   </a>
   , or by calling

   .

 </ul>
 <p>
  <em>
   VAERS is only for reporting reactions. They do not give medical advice
