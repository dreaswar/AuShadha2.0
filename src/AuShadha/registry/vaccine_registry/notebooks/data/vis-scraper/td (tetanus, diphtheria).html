  Why get vaccinated?
 </h3>
 <p>
  <span class="bold">
   Tetanus
  </span>
  and
  <span class="bold">
   diphtheria
  </span>
  are very serious diseases.  They are rare in the United States today, but people who do become infected often have severe complications. Td vaccine is used to protect adolescents and adults from both of these diseases.
 </p>
 <p>
  Both tetanus and diphtheria are infections caused by bacteria. Diphtheria spreads from person to person through coughing or sneezing. Tetanus-causing bacteria enter the body through cuts, scratches, or wounds.
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="bold">
   TETANUS
  </span>
  (Lockjaw) causes painful muscle tightening and stiffness, usually all over the body.
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   It can lead to tightening of muscles in the head and neck so you can't open your mouth,
swallow, or sometimes even breathe. Tetanus kills about 1 out of every 5 people who are infected.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  <span class="bold">
   DIPHTHERIA
  </span>
  can cause a thick coating to form in the back of the throat.
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   It can lead to breathing problems, paralysis, heart failure, and death.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Before vaccines, the United States saw as many as 200,000 cases a year of diphtheria and hundreds of cases of tetanus. Since vaccination began, cases of both diseases have dropped by about 99%.

   Td vaccine
  </span>
 </h3>
 <p>
  Td vaccine can protect adolescents and adults from tetanus and diphtheria. Td is usually given as a booster dose every 10 years but it can also be given earlier after a severe and dirty wound or burn.
 </p>
 <p>
  Your doctor can give you more information.
 </p>
 <p>
  Td may safely be given at the same time as other vaccines.

 </h3>
 <ul>
  <li>
   If you ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction after a dose of any tetanus or diphtheria containing vaccine, OR if you have a severe allergy to any part of this vaccine, you should not get Td.
   <em>
    Tell your doctor if you have any severe allergies
   </em>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   Talk to your doctor if you:
   <ul>

   Risks of a vaccine reaction
  </span>
 </h3>
 <p>
  With a vaccine, like any medicine, there is a chance of side effects. These are usually mild and go away on their own.
 </p>
 <p>
  Serious side effects are also possible, but are very rare.
 </p>
 <p>
  Most people who get Td vaccine do not have any problems with it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="bold">
   Mild Problems
  </span>

  <br/>
  <em>

  </em>
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Pain where the shot was given (about 8 people in 10)
  </li>
  <li>
   Redness or swelling where the shot was given (about 1 person in 3)
  </li>
  <li>
   Mild fever (about 1 person in 15)

 <ul>
  <li>

  </li>
 </ul>
 <p class="bold">
  Problems that could happen after any vaccine:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Brief fainting spells can happen after any medical procedure, including vaccination. Sitting or lying down for about 15 minutes can help prevent fainting, and injuries caused by a fall. Tell your doctor if you feel dizzy, or have vision changes or ringing in the ears.
  </li>
  <li>
   Severe shoulder pain and reduced range of motion in the arm where a shot was given can happen, very rarely, after a vaccination.
  </li>
  <li>
   Severe allergic reactions from a vaccine are very rare, estimated at less than 1 in a million doses. If one were to occur, it would usually be within a few minutes to a few hours after the vaccination.

   What if there is a serious reaction?
  </span>
 </h3>
 <h4>
  What should I look for?
 </h4>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <p>
    Look for anything that concerns you, such as signs of a severe allergic reaction, very high 		fever, or behavior changes.
   </p>
   <p>
    Signs of a severe allergic reaction can include hives, swelling of the face and throat, 
difficulty breathing, a fast heartbeat, dizziness, and weakness. These would usually start a few minutes to a few hours after the vaccination.
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <h4>
  What should I do?
 </h4>
 <ul>
  <li>
   If you think it is a severe allergic reaction or other emergency that canât wait, call 9-1-1 or get the person to the nearest hospital. Otherwise, call your doctor.
  </li>
  <li>
   Afterward, the reaction should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Your doctor might file this report, or you can do it yourself through the
   <a href="http://www.vaers.hhs.gov">
    VAERS website
   </a>
   , or by calling
   <span class="bold">
    1-800-822-7967

 </ul>

   VAERS is only for reporting reactions. They do not give medical advice
