  Why get vaccinated?
 </h3>
 <p>
  <span class="bold">
   Diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis are serious diseases caused by bacteria.
  </span>
  Diphtheria and pertussis are spread from person to person. Tetanus enters the body through cuts or wounds.
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="bold">
   DIPHTHERIA
  </span>
  causes a thick covering in the back of the throat.
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   It can lead to breathing problems, paralysis, heart failure, and even death.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  <span class="bold">
   TETANUS (Lockjaw)
  </span>
  causes painful tightening of the muscles, usually all over the body.
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   It can lead to "locking" of the jaw so the victim cannot open his mouth or swallow. Tetanus leads to death in up to 2 out of 10 cases.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  <span class="bold">
   PERTUSSIS (Whooping Cough)
  </span>
  causes coughing spells so bad that it is hard for infants to eat, drink, or breathe. These spells can last for weeks.
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   It can lead to pneumonia, seizures (jerking and staring spells), brain damage, and death.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  <span class="bold">
   Diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis vaccine (DTaP) can help prevent these diseases.
  </span>
  Most children who are vaccinated with DTaP will be protected throughout childhood. Many more children would get these diseases if we stopped vaccinating.
 </p>
 <p>
  DTaP is a safer version of an older vaccine called DTP. DTP is no longer used in the United States.

   Who should get DTaP vaccine and when?
  </span>
 </h3>
 <p>
  Children should get
  <span class="bold">
   5 doses
  </span>
  of DTaP vaccine, one dose at each of the following ages:
 </p>
 <p>
  ✓2 months
 </p>
 <p>
  ✓4 months
 </p>
 <p>
  ✓6 months
 </p>
 <p>
  ✓15-18 months
 </p>
 <p>
  ✓4-6 years
 </p>
 <p>
  DTaP may be given at the same time as other vaccines.

   Some children should not get DTaP vaccine or should wait
  </span>
 </h3>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Children with minor illnesses, such as a cold, may be vaccinated. But children who are moderately or severely ill should usually wait until they recover before getting DTaP vaccine.
  </li>
  <li>
   Any child who had a life-threatening allergic reaction after a dose of DTaP should not get another dose.
  </li>
  <li>
   Any child who suffered a brain or nervous system disease within 7 days after a dose of DTaP should not get another dose.
  </li>
  <li>
   Talk with your doctor if your child:
   <ul>
    <li>
     had a seizure or collapsed after a dose of DTaP,
    </li>
    <li>
     cried non-stop for 3 hours or more after a dose of DTaP,
    </li>
    <li>
     had a fever over 105°F after a dose of DTaP.
    </li>
   </ul>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Ask your doctor for more information. Some of these children should not get another dose of pertussis vaccine, but may get a vaccine without pertussis, called
  <span class="bold">
   DT
  </span>
  .

  Older children and adults
 </h3>
 <p>
  DTaP is not licensed for adolescents, adults, or children 7 years of age and older.
 </p>
 <p>
  But older people still need protection. A vaccine called
  <span class="bold">
   Tdap
  </span>
  is similar to DTaP. A single dose of Tdap is recommended for people 11 through 64 years of age. Another vaccine, called
  <span class="bold">
   Td
  </span>
  , protects against tetanus and diphtheria, but not pertussis. It is recommended every 10 years. There are separate Vaccine Information Statements for these vaccines.

   What are the risks from DTaP vaccine?
  </span>
 </h3>
 <p>
  Getting diphtheria, tetanus, or pertussis disease is
much riskier than getting DTaP vaccine.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, a vaccine, like any medicine, is capable of
      causing serious problems, such as severe allergic
      reactions. The risk of DTaP vaccine causing serious
      harm, or death, is extremely small.
 </p>
 <h4>
  Mild Problems (Common)
 </h4>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Fever (up to about 1 child in 4)
  </li>
  <li>
   Redness or swelling where the shot was given (up to
        about 1 child in 4)
  </li>
  <li>
   Soreness or tenderness where the shot was given (up
        to about 1 child in 4)
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  These problems occur more often after the 4th and 5th
doses of the DTaP series than after earlier doses.
Sometimes the 4th or 5th dose of DTaP vaccine is
followed by swelling of the entire arm or leg in which
the shot was given, lasting 1-7 days (up to about 1
child in 30).
 </p>
 <h4>
  Other mild problems include:
 </h4>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Fussiness (up to about 1 child in 3)
  </li>
  <li>
   Tiredness or poor appetite (up to about 1 child in 10)
  </li>
  <li>
   Vomiting (up to about 1 child in 50)
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  These problems generally occur 1-3 days after the shot.
 </p>
 <h4>
  Moderate Problems (Uncommon)
 </h4>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Seizure (jerking or staring) (about 1 child out of
14,000)
  </li>
  <li>
   Non-stop crying, for 3 hours or more (up to about
        1 child out of 1,000)
  </li>
  <li>
   High fever, over 105°F (about 1 child out of
        16,000)
  </li>
 </ul>
 <h4>
  Severe Problems (Very Rare)
 </h4>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Serious allergic reaction (less than 1 out of a million
doses)
  </li>
  <li>
   Several other severe problems have been reported
        after DTaP vaccine. These include:
   <ul>
    <li>
     Long-term seizures, coma, or lowered consciousness
    </li>
    <li>
     Permanent brain damage.
    </li>
   </ul>
   These are so rare it is hard to tell if they are caused
        by the vaccine.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Controlling fever is especially important for children
who have had seizures, for any reason. It is also
important if another family member has had seizures.
You can reduce fever and pain by giving your child an
  <em>
   aspirin-free
  </em>
  pain reliever when the shot is given, and
for the next 24 hours, following the package
instructions.

   What if there is a serious reaction?
  </span>
 </h3>
 <h4>
  What should I look for?
 </h4>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <p>
    Look for anything that concerns you, such as signs of a severe allergic reaction, very high fever, or behavior changes.
   </p>
   <p>
    Signs of a severe allergic reaction can include hives, swelling of the face and throat, difficulty breathing, a fast heartbeat, dizziness, and weakness. These would start a few minutes to a few hours after the vaccination.
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <h4>
  What should I do?
 </h4>
 <ul>
  <li>
   If you think it is a severe allergic reaction or other emergency that canât wait, call 9-1-1 or get the person to the nearest hospital. Otherwise, call your doctor.
  </li>
  <li>
   Afterward, the reaction should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Your doctor might file this report, or you can do it yourself through the
   <a href="http://www.vaers.hhs.gov">
    VAERS website
   </a>
   , or by calling
