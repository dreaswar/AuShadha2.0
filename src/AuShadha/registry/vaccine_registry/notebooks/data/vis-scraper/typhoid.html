  What is typhoid?
 </h3>
 <p>
  Typhoid (typhoid fever) is a serious disease. It is caused by bacteria called
  <em>
   Salmonella
  </em>
  Typhi.
 </p>
 <p>
  Typhoid causes a high fever, fatigue, weakness, stomach pains, headache, loss of appetite, and sometimes a rash. If it is not treated, it can kill up to 30% of people who get it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some people who get typhoid become "carriers," who can spread the disease to others.
 </p>
 <p>
  Generally, people get typhoid from contaminated food or water. Typhoid is rare in the U.S., and most
              U.S. citizens who get the disease get it while traveling. Typhoid strikes about 21 million people a year around the world and kills about 200,000.

  Typhoid vaccines
 </h3>
 <p>
  Typhoid vaccine can prevent typhoid.
 </p>
 <p>
  There are two vaccines to prevent typhoid. One is an inactivated (killed) vaccine gotten as a shot. The other is a live, attenuated (weakened) vaccine which is taken orally (by mouth).

 </h3>
 <p>
  Routine typhoid vaccination is not recommended in the United States, but typhoid vaccine is recommended for:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Travelers to parts of the world where typhoid is common. (
   <span class="bold">

  </li>
  <li>
   People in close contact with a typhoid carrier.
  </li>
  <li>
   Laboratory workers who work with
   <em>
    Salmonella
   </em>
   Typhi bacteria.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <h4>
  Inactivated typhoid vaccine (shot)
 </h4>
 <ul>
  <li>
   One dose provides protection. It should be given at least 2 weeks before travel to allow the vaccine time to work.
  </li>
  <li>
   A booster dose is needed every 2 years for people who remain at risk.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <h4>
  Live typhoid vaccine (oral)
 </h4>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Four doses: one capsule every other day for a week (day 1, day 3, day 5, and day 7). The last dose should be given at least 1 week before travel to allow the vaccine time to work.
  </li>
  <li>
   Swallow each dose about an hour before a meal with a cold or lukewarm drink.
   <em>
    Do not chew the capsule
   </em>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   A booster dose is needed every 5 years for people who remain at risk.
  </li>
 </ul>

   What are the risks from typhoid vaccine?
  </span>
 </h3>
 <p>
  Like any medicine, a vaccine could cause a serious problem, such as a severe allergic reaction. The risk of typhoid vaccine causing serious harm, or death, is extremely small. Serious problems from either typhoid vaccine are very rare.

  What if there is a serious reaction?
 </h3>
 <h4>
  What should I look for?
 </h4>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <p>
    Look for anything that concerns you, such as signs of a severe allergic reaction, very high fever, or behavior changes.
   </p>
   <p>
    Signs of a severe allergic reaction can include hives, swelling of the face and throat, difficulty breathing, a fast heartbeat, dizziness, and weakness. These would start a few minutes to a few hours after the vaccination.
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <h4>
  What should I do?
 </h4>
 <ul>
  <li>
   If you think it is a severe allergic reaction or other emergency that canât wait, call 9-1-1 or get the person to the nearest hospital. Otherwise, call your doctor.
  </li>
  <li>
   Afterward, the reaction should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Your doctor might file this report, or you can do it yourself through the
   <a href="http://www.vaers.hhs.gov">
    VAERS website
   </a>
   , or by calling
