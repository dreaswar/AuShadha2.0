  What is hepatitis B?
 </h3>
 <p>
  Hepatitis B is a serious infection that affects the liver. It is caused by the hepatitis B virus.
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   In 2009, about 38,000 people became infected with hepatitis B.
  </li>
  <li>
   Each year about 2,000 to 4,000 people die in the United States from cirrhosis or liver cancer caused by hepatitis B.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Hepatitis B can cause:
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="bold">
   Acute (short-term) illness.
  </span>
  This can lead to:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   loss of appetite
  </li>
  <li>
   tiredness
  </li>
  <li>
   pain in muscles, joints, and stomach
  </li>
  <li>
   diarrhea and vomiting
  </li>
  <li>
   jaundice (yellow skin or eyes)
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Acute illness, with symptoms, is more common among adults. Children who become infected usually do not have symptoms.
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="bold">
   Chronic (long-term) infection.
  </span>
  Some people go on to develop chronic hepatitis B infection. Most of them do not have symptoms, but the infection is still very serious, and can lead to:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   liver damage (cirrhosis)
  </li>
  <li>
   liver cancer
  </li>
  <li>
   death
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Chronic infection is more common among infants and children than among adults. People who are chronically infected can spread hepatitis B virus to others, even if they donât look or feel sick. Up to 1.4 million people in the United States may have chronic hepatitis B infection.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hepatitis B virus is easily spread through contact with the blood or other body fluids of an infected person. People can also be infected from contact with a contaminated object, where the virus can live for up to 7 days.
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   A baby whose mother is infected can be infected at birth;
  </li>
  <li>
   Children, adolescents, and adults can become infected by:
   <ul>
    <li>
     contact with blood and body fluids through breaks in the skin such as bites, cuts, or sores;
    </li>
    <li>
     contact with objects that have blood or body fluids on them such as toothbrushes, razors, or monitoring and treatment devices for diabetes;
    </li>
    <li>
     having unprotected sex with an infected person;
    </li>
    <li>
     sharing needles when injecting drugs;
    </li>
    <li>
     being stuck with a used needle.
    </li>
   </ul>
  </li>
 </ul>

   Hepatitis B vaccine: Why get vaccinated?
  </span>
 </h3>
 <p>
  Hepatitis B vaccine can prevent hepatitis B, and the serious consequences of hepatitis B infection, including
liver cancer and cirrhosis.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hepatitis B vaccine may be given by itself or in the same shot with other vaccines.
 </p>
 <p>
  Routine hepatitis B vaccination was recommended for some U.S. adults and children beginning in 1982, and for all children in 1991. Since 1990, new hepatitis B infections among children and adolescents have dropped by more than 95% – and by 75% in other age groups.
 </p>
 <p>
  Vaccination gives long-term protection from hepatitis B infection, possibly lifelong.

   Who should get hepatitis B vaccine and when?
  </span>
 </h3>
 <h4>
  Children and adolescents
 </h4>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Babies normally get 3 doses of hepatitis B vaccine:
   <ul>
    <li>
     1st Dose: Birth
    </li>
    <li>
     2nd Dose: 1-2 months of age
    </li>
    <li>
     3rd Dose: 6-18 months of age
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    Some babies might get 4 doses, for example, if a combination vaccine containing hepatitis B is used. (This is a single shot containing several vaccines.) The extra dose is not harmful.
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Anyone through 18 years of age who didn't get the vaccine when they were younger should also be
              vaccinated.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <h4>
  Adults
 </h4>
 <ul>
  <li>
   All unvaccinated adults at risk for hepatitis B infection should be vaccinated. This includes:
   <ul>
    <li>
     sex partners of people infected with hepatitis B,
    </li>
    <li>
     men who have sex with men,
    </li>
    <li>
     people who inject street drugs,
    </li>
    <li>
     people with more than one sex partner,
    </li>
    <li>
     people with chronic liver or kidney disease,
    </li>
    <li>
     people under 60 years of age with diabetes,
    </li>
    <li>
     people with jobs that expose them to human blood or other body fluids,
    </li>
    <li>
     household contacts of people infected with hepatitis B,
    </li>
    <li>
     residents and staff in institutions for the developmentally disabled,
    </li>
    <li>
     kidney dialysis patients,
    </li>
    <li>
     people who travel to countries where hepatitis B is
                    common,
    </li>
    <li>
     people with HIV infection.
    </li>
   </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
   Other people may be encouraged by their doctor to get hepatitis B vaccine; for example, adults 60 and older with diabetes. Anyone else who wants to be protected from hepatitis B infection may get the vaccine.
  </li>
  <li>
   Pregnant women who are at risk for one of the reasons stated above should be vaccinated. Other pregnant women who want protection may be vaccinated.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Adults getting hepatitis B vaccine should get 3 doses — with the second dose given 4 weeks after the first and the third dose 5 months after the second. Your doctor can tell you about other dosing schedules that might be used in certain circumstances.

   Who should not get hepatitis B vaccine?
  </span>
 </h3>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Anyone with a life-threatening allergy to yeast, or to any other component of the vaccine, should not get hepatitis B vaccine. Tell your doctor if you have any severe allergies.
  </li>
  <li>
   Anyone who has had a life-threatening allergic reaction to a previous dose of hepatitis B vaccine should not get another dose.
  </li>
  <li>
   Anyone who is moderately or severely ill when a dose of vaccine is scheduled should probably wait until they recover before getting the vaccine.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Your doctor can give you more information about these precautions.
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="bold">
   Note:
  </span>
  You might be asked to wait 28 days before donating blood after getting hepatitis B vaccine. This is because the screening test could mistake vaccine in the bloodstream (which is not infectious) for hepatitis B infection.

   What are the risks from hepatitis B vaccine?
  </span>
 </h3>
 <p>
  Hepatitis B is a very safe vaccine. Most people do not have any problems with it.
 </p>
 <p>
  The vaccine contains non-infectious material, and cannot cause hepatitis B infection.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some mild problems have been reported:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Soreness where the shot was given (up to about 1 person in 4).
  </li>
  <li>
   Temperature of 99.9Â°F or higher (up to about 1 person in 15).
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Severe problems are extremely rare. Severe allergic reactions are believed to occur about once in 1.1 million doses.
 </p>
 <p>
  A vaccine, like any medicine, could cause a serious reaction. But the risk of a vaccine causing serious harm, or death, is extremely small. More than 100 million people in the United States have been vaccinated with hepatitis B vaccine.

   What if there is a serious reaction?
  </span>
 </h3>
 <h4>
  What should I look for?
 </h4>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <p>
    Look for anything that concerns you, such as signs of a severe allergic reaction, very high fever, or behavior changes.
   </p>
   <p>
    Signs of a severe allergic reaction can include hives, swelling of the face and throat, difficulty breathing, a fast heartbeat, dizziness, and weakness. These would start a few minutes to a few hours after the vaccination.
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <h4>
  What should I do?
 </h4>
 <ul>
  <li>
   If you think it is a severe allergic reaction or other emergency that canât wait, call 9-1-1 or get the person to the nearest hospital. Otherwise, call your doctor.
  </li>
  <li>
   Afterward, the reaction should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Your doctor might file this report, or you can do it yourself through the
   <a href="http://www.vaers.hhs.gov">
    VAERS website
   </a>
   , or by calling

   The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program
  </span>
 </h3>
 <p>
  The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) is a federal program that was created to compensate people who may have been injured by certain vaccines.
 </p>

  Persons who believe they may have been injured by a vaccine can learn about the program and about filing a claim by calling
