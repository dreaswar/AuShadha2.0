  Why get vaccinated?
 </h3>
 <p>
  <span class="bold">
   Tetanus
  </span>
  ,
  <span class="bold">
   diphtheria
  </span>
  and
  <span class="bold">
   pertussis
  </span>
  can be very serious diseases, even for adolescents and adults. Tdap vaccine can protect us from these diseases.
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="bold">
   TETANUS
  </span>
  (Lockjaw) causes painful muscle tightening and stiffness, usually all over the body.
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   It can lead to tightening of muscles in the head and neck so you can't open your mouth, 
	swallow, or sometimes even breathe. Tetanus kills about 1 out of 5 people who are infected.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  <span class="bold">
   DIPHTHERIA
  </span>
  can cause a thick coating to form in the back of the throat.
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   It can lead to breathing problems, paralysis, heart failure, and death.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  <span class="bold">
   PERTUSSIS
  </span>
  (Whooping Cough) causes severe coughing spells, which can cause difficulty breathing, vomiting and disturbed sleep.
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   It can also lead to weight loss, incontinence, and rib fractures. Up to 2 in 100 adolescents and 5 in 100 adults with pertussis are hospitalized or have complications, which could include pneumonia or death.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  These diseases are caused by bacteria. Diphtheria and pertussis are spread from person to person through coughing or sneezing. Tetanus enters the body through cuts, scratches, or wounds.
 </p>
 <p>
  Before vaccines, the United States saw as many as 200,000 cases a year of diphtheria and pertussis, and hundreds of cases of tetanus. Since vaccination began, tetanus and diphtheria have dropped by about 99% and pertussis by about 80%.

   Tdap vaccine
  </span>
 </h3>
 <p>
  Tdap vaccine can protect adolescents and adults from tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis. One dose of Tdap is routinely given at age 11 or 12.  People who did
  <em>
   not
  </em>
  get Tdap at that age should get it as soon as possible.
 </p>
 <p>
  Tdap is especially important for healthcare professionals and anyone having close contact with a baby younger than 12 months.
 </p>
 <p>
  Pregnant women should get a dose of Tdap during
  <em>
   every
  </em>
  pregnancy, to protect the newborn from pertussis. Infants are most at risk for severe,  life-threatening complications from pertussis.
 </p>
 <p>
  A similar vaccine, called Td, protects from tetanus and diphtheria, but not pertussis. A Td booster should be given every 10 years. Tdap may be given as one of these boosters if you have not already gotten a dose.  Tdap may also be given after a severe cut or burn to prevent tetanus infection.
 </p>
 <p>
  Your doctor can give you more information.
 </p>
 <p>
  Tdap may safely be given at the same time as other vaccines.

  Some people should not get this vaccine
 </h3>
 <ul>
  <li>
   If you ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction after a dose of any  tetanus, diphtheria, or pertussis containing vaccine, OR if you have a severe allergy to any part of this vaccine, you should not get Tdap.Â
   <em>
    Tell your doctor ifÂ you have any severe allergies.
   </em>
  </li>
  <li>
   If you had a coma, or long or multiple seizures within 7 days after a childhood dose of DTP or DTaP, you should not get Tdap, unless a cause other than the vaccine was found.  You can still get Td.
  </li>
  <li>
   Talk to your doctor if you:
   <ul>
    <li>
     have epilepsy or another nervous system problem,
    </li>
    <li>
     had
     <em>
      severe
     </em>
     pain or swelling after any vaccine containing diphtheria, tetanus or pertussis,
    </li>
    <li>
     ever had Guillain Barré Syndrome (GBS),
    </li>
    <li>
     aren't feeling well on the day the shot is scheduled.

   Risks of a vaccine reaction
  </span>
 </h3>
 <p>
  With any medicine, including vaccines, there is a chance of side effects. These are usually mild and go away on their own, but serious reactions are also possible.
 </p>
 <p>
  Brief
  <span class="bold">
   fainting spells
  </span>
  can follow a vaccination, leading to injuries from falling. Sitting or lying down for about 15 minutes can help prevent these. Tell your doctor if you feel dizzy or light-headed, or have vision changes or ringing in the ears.

   What if there is a serious reaction?
  </span>
 </h3>
 <h4>
  What should I look for?
 </h4>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <p>
    Look for anything that concerns you, such as signs of a severe allergic reaction, very high fever, or behavior changes.
   </p>
   <p>
    Signs of a severe allergic reaction can include hives, swelling of the face and throat, difficulty breathing, a fast heartbeat, dizziness, and weakness. These would start a few minutes to a few hours after the vaccination.
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <h4>
  What should I do?
 </h4>
 <ul>
  <li>
   If you think it is a severe allergic reaction or other emergency that canât wait, call 9-1-1 or get the person to the nearest hospital. Otherwise, call your doctor.
  </li>
  <li>
   Afterward, the reaction should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Your doctor might file this report, or you can do it yourself through the
   <a href="http://www.vaers.hhs.gov">
    VAERS website
   </a>
   , or by calling
