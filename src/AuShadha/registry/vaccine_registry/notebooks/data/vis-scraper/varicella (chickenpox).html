  Why get vaccinated?
 </h3>
 <p>
  Chickenpox (also called varicella) is a common childhood disease. It is usually mild, but it can be serious, especially in young infants and adults.
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   It causes a rash, itching, fever, and tiredness.
  </li>
  <li>
   It can lead to severe skin infection, scars,
                pneumonia, brain damage, or death.
  </li>
  <li>
   The chickenpox virus can be spread from person
                to person through the air, or by contact with fluid
                from chickenpox blisters.
  </li>
  <li>
   A person who has had chickenpox can get a
                painful rash called shingles years later.
  </li>
  <li>
   Before the vaccine, about 11,000 people were
                hospitalized for chickenpox each year in the
                United States.
  </li>
  <li>
   Before the vaccine, about 100 people died each year
                as a result of chickenpox in the United States.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Chickenpox vaccine can prevent chickenpox.
 </p>
 <p>
  Most people who get chickenpox vaccine will not get chickenpox. But if someone who has been vaccinated does get chickenpox, it is usually very mild. They will have fewer blisters, are less likely to have a fever, and will recover faster.

   Who should get chickenpox vaccine and when?
  </span>
 </h3>
 <h4>
  Routine
 </h4>
 <p>
  Children who have never had chickenpox should get 2 doses of chickenpox vaccine at these ages:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   1st Dose: 12-15 months of age
  </li>
  <li>
   2nd Dose: 4-6 years of age (may be given earlier, if at least 3 months after the 1st dose)
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  People 13 years of age and older (who have never had chickenpox or received chickenpox vaccine) should get two doses at least 28 days apart.
 </p>
 <h4>
  Catch-up
 </h4>
 <p>
  Anyone who is not fully vaccinated, and never had chickenpox, should receive one or two doses of chickenpox vaccine. The timing of these doses depends on the personâs age. Ask your doctor.
 </p>
 <p>
  Chickenpox vaccine may be given at the same time as other vaccines.

   Some people should not get chickenpox vaccine or should wait.
  </span>
 </h3>
 <ul>
  <li>
   People should not get chickenpox vaccine if they
have ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction
to a previous dose of chickenpox vaccine or to
gelatin or the antibiotic neomycin.
  </li>
  <li>
   People who are moderately or severely ill at the
                time the shot is scheduled should usually wait
                until they recover before getting chickenpox
                vaccine.
  </li>
  <li>
   Pregnant women should wait to get chickenpox
                vaccine until after they have given birth. Women
                should not get pregnant for 1 month after getting
                chickenpox vaccine.
  </li>
  <li>
   Some people should check with their doctor about
                whether they should get chickenpox vaccine,
                including anyone who:
   <ul>
    <li>
     Has HIV/AIDS or another disease that affects
                    the immune system
    </li>
    <li>
     Is being treated with drugs that affect the
                    immune system, such as steroids, for 2 weeks or
                    longer
    </li>
    <li>
     Has any kind of cancer
    </li>
    <li>
     Is getting cancer treatment with radiation or
                    drugs
    </li>
   </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
   People who recently had a transfusion or were
                    given other blood products should ask their
                    doctor when they may get chickenpox vaccine.
                  Ask your provider for more information.

   What are the risks from chickenpox vaccine?
  </span>
 </h3>
 <p>
  A vaccine, like any medicine, is capable of causing
serious problems, such as severe allergic reactions.
The risk of chickenpox vaccine causing serious harm,
or death, is extremely small.
 </p>
 <p>
  Getting chickenpox vaccine is much safer than
              getting chickenpox disease. Most people who get
              chickenpox vaccine do not have any problems with it.
              Reactions are usually more likely after the first dose
              than after the second.
 </p>
 <h4>
  Mild problems
 </h4>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Soreness or swelling where the shot was given
(about 1 out of 5 children and up to 1 out of 3
adolescents and adults)
  </li>
  <li>
   Fever (1 person out of 10, or less)
  </li>
  <li>
   Mild rash, up to a month after vaccination (1
                person out of 25). It is possible for these people to
                infect other members of their household, but this
                is extremely rare.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <h4>
  Moderate problems
 </h4>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Seizure (jerking or staring) caused by fever (very
              rare).
  </li>
 </ul>
 <h4>
  Severe problems
 </h4>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Pneumonia (very rare)
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Other serious problems, including severe brain reactions
and low blood count, have been reported after
chickenpox vaccination. These happen so rarely
experts cannot tell whether they are caused by the
vaccine or not. If they are, it is extremely rare.

      The first dose of
      <span class="bold">
       MMRV
      </span>
      vaccine
has been associated with rash and higher
rates of fever than MMR and varicella
vaccines given separately. Rash has been
reported in about 1 person in 20 and fever
in about 1 person in 5.
     </p>
     <p>
      Seizures caused by a fever are also reported
                      more often after MMRV. These usually
                      occur 5-12 days after the first dose.

   What if there is a serious reaction?
  </span>
 </h3>
 <h4>
  What should I look for?
 </h4>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <p>
    Look for anything that concerns you, such as signs of a severe allergic reaction, very high fever, or behavior changes.
   </p>
   <p>
    Signs of a severe allergic reaction can include hives, swelling of the face and throat, difficulty breathing, a fast heartbeat, dizziness, and weakness. These would start a few minutes to a few hours after the vaccination.
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <h4>
  What should I do?
 </h4>
 <ul>
  <li>
   If you think it is a severe allergic reaction or other emergency that canât wait, call 9-1-1 or get the person to the nearest hospital. Otherwise, call your doctor.
  </li>
  <li>
   Afterward, the reaction should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Your doctor might file this report, or you can do it yourself through the
   <a href="http://www.vaers.hhs.gov">
    VAERS website
   </a>
   , or by calling

  The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) is a federal program that was created to compensate people who may have been injured by certain vaccines.
