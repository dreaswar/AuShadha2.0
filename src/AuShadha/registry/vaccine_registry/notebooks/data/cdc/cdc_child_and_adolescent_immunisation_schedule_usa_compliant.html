        <li>Administer monovalent HepB vaccine to all newborns before hospital

        <li>For infants born to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive mothers, administer HepB vaccine and 0.5 mL of hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) within 12 hours of birth. These infants should be tested for HBsAg and antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs) 1 to 2 months after completion of the HepB series, at age 9 through 18 months (preferably at the next well-child visit).</li>
        <li>If mother's HBsAg status is unknown, within 12 hours of birth administer HepB vaccine regardless of birth weight. For infants weighing less than 2,000 grams, administer HBIG in addition to HepB vaccine within 12 hours of birth. Determine mother’s HBsAg status as soon as possible and, if mother is HBsAg-positive, also administer HBIG for infants weighing 2,000 grams or more as soon as possible, but no later than age 7 days.</li>

   <p>This schedule includes recommendations in effect as of January 1, 2014. Any dose not administered at the recommended age should be administered at a subsequent visit, when indicated and feasible. The use of a combination vaccine generally is preferred over separate injections of its equivalent component vaccines. Vaccination providers should consult the relevant Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) statement for <a href="/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/index.html" target="_blank">detailed recommendations</a>. Clinically significant adverse events that follow vaccination should be reported to  <a href="http://www.vaers.hhs.gov" target="_blank">Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS)</a> online or by telephone (800-822-7967). Suspected cases of vaccine-preventable diseases should be reported to the state or local health department.
