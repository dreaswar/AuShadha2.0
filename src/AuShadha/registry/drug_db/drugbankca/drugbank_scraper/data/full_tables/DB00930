Colesevelam is used with exercise and diet changes (restriction of cholesterol and fat intake) to reduce the amount of cholesterol and certain fatty substances in the blood. It works by binding bile acids in the intestine. Bile acids are made when cholesterol is broken down in the body. Removing these bile acids helps to lower blood cholesterol.</p></td></tr><tr><th>Structure</th><td><div class="structure"><a class="moldbi-thumbnail" href="http://structures.wishartlab.com/molecules/DB00930/image.png"><img alt="Thumb" src="http://structures.wishartlab.com/molecules/DB00930/thumb.png"></a></div><div class="structure-links"><div class="btn-group btn-group-xs"><a class="btn btn-default" href="/structures/structures/small_molecule_drugs/DB00930.mol">MOL</a><a class="btn btn-default" href="/structures/structures/small_molecule_drugs/DB00930.sdf">SDF</a><a class="btn btn-default" href="/structures/structures/small_molecule_drugs/DB00930.pdb">PDB</a><a class="btn btn-default" href="/structures/structures/small_molecule_drugs/DB00930.smiles">SMILES</a><a class="btn btn-default" href="/structures/structures/small_molecule_drugs/DB00930.inchi">InChI</a><a class="btn btn-info" href="/structures/structures/small_molecule_drugs/DB00930">View Structure</a></div></div></td></tr><tr><th>Synonyms</th><td><span class="wishart wishart-not-available">Not Available</span></td></tr><tr><th>Salts</th><td class="table-container"><table class="inner">

Colesevelam binds to bile acids in the intestine which reduces the amount of bile acids that are returned to the liver via enterohepatic circulation. Clinical studies have demonstrated that elevated levels of total cholesterol (total-C), LDL-C, and apolipoprotein B (Apo B, a protein associated with LDL-C) are associated with an increased risk of atherosclerosis in humans. Similarly, decreased levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) are associated with the development of atherosclerosis. Epidemiological investigations have established that cardiovascular morbidity and mortality vary directly with the levels of total-C and LDL-C, and inversely with the level of HDL-C. The combination of colesevelam and an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor is effective in further lowering serum total-C and LDL-C levels beyond that achieved by either agent alone.</td></tr><tr><th>Mechanism of action</th><td>Colesevelam is a non-absorbed, lipid-lowering polymer that binds bile acids in the intestine, impeding their reabsorption. As the bile acid pool becomes depleted, the hepatic enzyme, cholesterol 7-(alpha)-hydroxylase, is upregulated, which increases the conversion of cholesterol to bile acids. This causes an increased demand for cholesterol in the liver cells, resulting in the dual effect of increasing transcription and activity of the cholesterol biosynthetic enzyme, hydroxymethyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, and increasing the number of hepatic low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors. These compensatory effects result in increased clearance of LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) from the blood, resulting in decreased serum LDL-C levels. Serum triglyceride levels may increase or remain unchanged. The end result is increased clearance of LDL-cholesterol from the blood with decreased serum LDL-cholesterol.</td></tr><tr><th>Absorption</th><td>Not hydrolyzed by digestive enzymes and is not absorbed.</td></tr><tr><th>Volume of distribution</th><td><span class="wishart wishart-not-available">Not Available</span></td></tr><tr><th>Protein binding</th><td>Not applicable (not hydrolyzed by digestive enzymes and not absorbed).</td></tr><tr><th>Metabolism</th><td class="data-table-container"><p>Not applicable (not hydrolyzed by digestive enzymes and not absorbed).</p></td></tr><tr><th>Route of elimination</th><td>Excretion:  In 16 healthy volunteers, an average of 0.05% of administered radioactivity from a single 14C-labeled colesevelam hydrochloride dose was excreted in the urine.</td></tr><tr><th>Half life</th><td><span class="wishart wishart-not-available">Not Available</span></td></tr><tr><th>Clearance</th><td><span class="wishart wishart-not-available">Not Available</span></td></tr><tr><th>Toxicity</th><td>Symptoms of overdose may include eye irritation, constipation, abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and hypersensitivity.
