Also used in combination with other agents for the symptomatic relief of symptoms associated with the common cold.</td></tr><tr><th>Pharmacodynamics</th><td>In allergic reactions an allergen interacts with and cross-links surface IgE antibodies on mast cells and basophils. Once the mast cell-antibody-antigen complex is formed, a complex series of events occurs that eventually leads to cell-degranulation and the release of histamine (and other chemical mediators) from the mast cell or basophil. Once released, histamine can react with local or widespread tissues through histamine receptors. Histamine, acting on H1-receptors, produces pruritis, vasodilatation, hypotension, flushing, headache, tachycardia, and bronchoconstriction. Histamine also increases vascular permeability and potentiates pain. Triprolidine, is a histamine H1 antagonist that competes with histamine for the normal H1-receptor sites on effector cells of the gastrointestinal tract, blood vessels and respiratory tract. It provides effective, temporary relief of sneezing, watery and itchy eyes, and runny nose due to hay fever and other upper respiratory allergies. Triprolidine has anticholinergic and sedative effects.</td></tr><tr><th>Mechanism of action</th><td>Triprolidine binds to the histamine H1 receptor. This blocks the action of endogenous histamine, which subsequently leads to temporary relief of the negative symptoms brought on by histamine.</td></tr><tr><th>Absorption</th><td>Rapidly absorbed in the intestinal tract.</td></tr><tr><th>Volume of distribution</th><td><span class="wishart wishart-not-available">Not Available</span></td></tr><tr><th>Protein binding</th><td><span class="wishart wishart-not-available">Not Available</span></td></tr><tr><th>Metabolism</th><td class="data-table-container"></td></tr><tr><th>Route of elimination</th><td><span class="wishart wishart-not-available">Not Available</span></td></tr><tr><th>Half life</th><td>4 to 6 hours.</td></tr><tr><th>Clearance</th><td><span class="wishart wishart-not-available">Not Available</span></td></tr><tr><th>Toxicity</th><td>Symptoms of overdose include drowsiness, weakness, inco-ordination, difficulty with micturition, respiratory depression, hypotension, agitation, irritability, convulsions, hypertension, palpitation and tachycardia.</td></tr><tr><th>Affected organisms</th><td><ul><li>Humans and other mammals</li></ul></td></tr><tr><th>Pathways</th><td><span class="wishart wishart-not-available">Not Available</span></td></tr><tr><th>SNP Mediated Effects</th><td><span class="wishart wishart-not-available">Not Available</span></td></tr><tr><th>SNP Mediated Adverse Drug Reactions</th><td><span class="wishart wishart-not-available">Not Available</span></td></tr><tr id="admet"><th class="divider" colspan="2">ADMET</th></tr><tr><th>Predicted ADMET features</th><td class="data-table-container"><table class="table table-condensed table-striped" id="predicted-admet">
