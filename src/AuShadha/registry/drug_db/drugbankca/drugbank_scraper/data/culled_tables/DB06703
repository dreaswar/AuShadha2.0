Indicated for adults and children age 2 and over for contrast enhancement during cranial and spinal MRI, and for contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (CE-MRA). Gadobutrol is particularly suited for the detection of very small lesions and for the visualization of tumors that do not readily take up contrast media. It may be a desired agent when the exclusion or demonstration of an additional pathology may influence the choice of therapy or patient management. It may also be suitable for perfusion studies in the diagnosis of stroke, detection of focal cerebral ischemia, and in studies of tumor perfusion. </td></tr><tr><th>Pharmacodynamics</th><td>Even at low concentrations Gadobutrol can lead to distinct shortening of relaxation times of protons in plasma. At physiological conditions (pH=7, temperature=37&#176;C), and 1.5T, the relaxivity (r1) is 5.2L/(mmol&#183;sec) based on the relaxation times (T1), while the relativity (r2) is 6.1L/(mmol&#183;sec) based on relaxation times (T2). 

Magnetic field strength has only slight influence on relaxivities.  

Drug concentration and r1 relaxivity may contribute to a T1 shortening effect, which may improve tissue visualization. </td></tr><tr><th>Mechanism of action</th><td>MRI tissue visualization is dependent, in part, on variations in intensity of radiofrequency signals which occur due to differences in proton density, differences of the spin-lattice or longitudinal relaxation times (T1), and differences in the spin-spin or transverse relaxation times (T2).

Gadolinium shortens T1 and T2 relaxation times. Greater signal enhancement is achieved with increased shortening of T1 and T2. The extent to which Gadolinium can shorten T1 and T2 is influenced by concentration in tissue, MRI field strength, and the relative ratio of transverse and longitudinal relaxation times. 

The recommended dose produced the greatest sensitivity of T1 shortening effect in T1-weighted magnetic resonance sequences. 
In T2-weighted sequences, the large magnetic moment of gadolinium induced local magnetic field inhomogenenities. 

At high concentrations used during bolus injections, T2-weighted sequences show a signal decrease.        </td></tr><tr><th>Absorption</th><td>With normal renal function, the AUC is 1.1 &#177; 0.1 mmol&#183;h/L. </td></tr><tr><th>Volume of distribution</th><td><p>Rapid distribution to extracellular space occurs after intravenous administration.</p>
<p>After a dose of 0.1mmol/kg body weight, an average plasma level of 0.59 mmol/L was measured 2 minutes post injection, and 0.3mmol/L 60 minutes post injection.</p></td></tr><tr><th>Protein binding</th><td>No particular protein binding is displayed.</td></tr><tr><th>Metabolism</th><td class="data-table-container"><p>Gadobutrol is not metabolized. </p></td></tr><tr><th>Route of elimination</th><td>Excreted unchanged via glomerular filtration by the kidneys. 
Extrarenal elimination is negligible. </td></tr><tr><th>Half life</th><td>1.81 hours (1.33-2.13 hours). </td></tr><tr><th>Clearance</th><td><p>In healthy subjects, renal clearance is 1.1 &#8211; 1.7mL/(min&#183;kg).<br>
Within 2 hours of intravenous injection more than 50% is eliminated via the urine. Within 12 hours more than 90% of the given dose is eliminated.</p>
<p>Clearance was observed to be slightly lower in elderly subjects, when using a 0.1mmol/kg dose.</p>
<p>In the pediatric population, the median <span class="caps">AUC</span>, clearance and elimination half life was observed to be similar across the age range of 2-17, based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of 130 pediatric subjects aged 2-17. In children aged 2-6 (n=45) the median <span class="caps">AUC</span> of gadobutrol was 0.8 mmol&#183;h/L, the median clearance was 0.13L/hr/kg, and the median elimination half life was 1.75h. In children aged 7-11 (n=39) the median <span class="caps">AUC</span> of gadobutrol was 1.0 mmol&#183;h/L, the median clearance was 0.1L/hr/kg, and the median elimination half life was 1.61h. In children aged 12-17 (n=46) the median <span class="caps">AUC</span> of gadobutrol was 1.2 mmol&#183;h/L, the median clearance was 0.09 L/hr/kg, and the median elimination half life was 1.65h. <br>
Approximately 99% (median value) of the dose was recovered in the urine after 6 hours.</p>
<p>A prolonged serum half life of gadobutrol is correlated with a reduction in creatinine clearance. In patients with mild-moderate renal impairment (80&gt;CLCR&gt;30 mL/min) the elimination half life was 5.8 &#177; 2.4 hours, the <span class="caps">AUC</span> was 4.0 &#177; 1.8 mmol&#183;h/L, and complete recovery from the urine is seen within 72 hours. <br>
In patients with severe renal impairment (<span class="caps">CLCR</span>&lt;30 mL/min) the elimination half life was 17.6 &#177; 6.2 hours, the <span class="caps">AUC</span> was 11.5 &#177; 4.3 mmol&#183;h/L, and complete recovery from the urine is seen within 5 days.        <br>
Physicians may consider the prompt initiation of hemodialysis following gadobutrol administration to aid elimination, in patients who are already receiving hemodialysis. After one dialysis session 68% of the initial dose is removed, after the second session 94%, and after the third session 98%.</p></td></tr><tr><th>Toxicity</th><td>Lethality was observed in rodents after a single intravenous administration of 20 mmol/kg. This represents a dose of at least 2 orders of magnitude
higher than the standard single diagnostic dose in humans (0.1 mmol/kg).

No carcinogenicity studies have been conducted. 

No mutagenesis was observed in vitro in reverse mutation tests in bacteria, or in the HGPRT (hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase) test using Chinese hamster V79 cells. Similarly, no mutagenesis was seen in chromosome abberation tests of human peripheral blood lymphocytes. It was also negative in in-vivo micronucleus tests in mice following a 0.5mmol/kg intravenous injection. 

No fertility or reproductive impairment was observed in male and female rates given doses 12.2 times human equivalent doses, based on body surface area.    

Intolerance reactions local to the injection site have been observed in rabbits after paravenous administration, and are associated with the infiltration of inflammatory cells, suggesting the possibility of local irritation if the contrast medium leaks around veins in a clinical setting. </td></tr><tr><th>Affected organisms</th><td><ul><li>Humans and other mammals</li></ul></td></tr><tr><th>Pathways</th><td><span class="wishart wishart-not-available">Not Available</span></td></tr><tr><th>SNP Mediated Effects</th><td><span class="wishart wishart-not-available">Not Available</span></td></tr><tr><th>SNP Mediated Adverse Drug Reactions</th><td><span class="wishart wishart-not-available">Not Available</span></td></tr><tr id="admet"><th class="divider" colspan="2">ADMET</th></tr><tr><th>Predicted ADMET features</th><td class="data-table-container"><table class="table table-condensed table-striped" id="predicted-admet">
