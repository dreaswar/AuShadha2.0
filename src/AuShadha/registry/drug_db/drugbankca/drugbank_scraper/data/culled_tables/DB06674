Golimumab binds and inhibits soluble and transmembrane human TNF&#945;. Increased TNF&#945; is associated with chronic inflammation. Thus golimumab is indicated for use in adults (i) as an adjunct to methotrexate treatment in patients with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis (RA), (ii) alone or as an adjunct to methotrexate treatment in patients with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA), (iii) as a single agent in patients with active ankylosing spondylitis (AS), and (iv) as a single agent in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis (UC) who require chronic steroids or have experienced intolerance or only a partial response to previous medications. In the U.S. and Canada, golimumab is marketed under the brand name Simponi&#174;. The <span class="caps">FDA</span> label includes a black box warning of serious infections and malignancy. Additionally in children and adolescents taking golimumab, there have been lymphoma and other malignancies observed.</p></td></tr><tr><th>Protein structure</th><td><img alt="No structure small" src="/assets/no_structure_small-e8790a148b09ecc5ad9f5b4926a538e7.png"></td></tr><tr><th>Protein chemical formula</th><td>C<sub>6530</sub>H<sub>10068</sub>N<sub>1752</sub>O<sub>2026</sub>S<sub>44</sub> </td></tr><tr><th>Protein average weight</th><td>146943.1937 daltons</td></tr><tr><th>Sequences</th><td></td></tr><tr><th>Synonyms</th><td><span class="wishart wishart-not-available">Not Available</span></td></tr><tr><th>Salts</th><td><span class="wishart wishart-not-available">Not Available</span></td></tr><tr><th>Brand names</th><td class="data-table-container"><table class="table table-condensed table-striped datatable" id="brands"><thead><tr><th>Name</th><th>Company</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Simponi</td><td>Centocor Ortho Biotec</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><th>Brand mixtures</th><td><span class="wishart wishart-not-available">Not Available</span></td></tr><tr><th>Categories</th><td><ul><li><a href="/mesh/antipsoriatic-agents">Antipsoriatic Agents</a></li>

</td></tr><tr><th>Pharmacodynamics</th><td>Golimumab inhibits the activity of the cytokine, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF&#945;). In areas such as the joints and blood, increased TNF&#945; is associated with chronic inflammation seen in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis. Thus golimumab decreases the inflammation in these conditions. Concerning ulcerative colitis, the physiological effects of golimumab has yet to be determined.

 </td></tr><tr><th>Mechanism of action</th><td>As a human monoclonal antibody, golimumab binds and inhibits soluble and transmembrane human TNF&#945;. Inhibition of TNF&#945; prevents it binding to its receptors, which prevents both leukocyte infiltration through prevention of cell adhesion proteins such as E-selectin, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1, and pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion such as IL-6, IL-8, G-CSF and GM-CSF in vitro. Consequently, in patients with chronic inflammatory conditions, decreases in ICAM-1 and IL-6 as well as C-reactive protein (CRP), matrix metalloproteinase 3 (MMP-3), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were observed.
  

  

 </td></tr><tr><th>Absorption</th><td>After subcutaneous administration, golimumab can achieve 
maximum serum concentrations in 2 to 6 days and has an approximate bioavailability of 53%. In healthy volunteers, the maximum average concentration reached was 3.2 &#177; 1.4 &#956;g/mL. </td></tr><tr><th>Volume of distribution</th><td><p>After IV administration, golimumab has a volume of distribution of about 58 to 126 mL/kg. This means that golimumab stays mostly in the circulatory system.</p></td></tr><tr><th>Protein binding</th><td>Plasma protein binding was not quantified.</td></tr><tr><th>Metabolism</th><td class="data-table-container"><p>The metabolism of golimumab has yet to be determined.</p></td></tr><tr><th>Route of elimination</th><td>The route of elimination for golimumab has yet to be determined.</td></tr><tr><th>Half life</th><td>Golimumab has a long half-life of about 2 weeks.</td></tr><tr><th>Clearance</th><td><p>After one IV dose of golimumab, the systemic clearance was about 4.9 to 6.7 mL/day/kg.</p></td></tr><tr><th>Toxicity</th><td>The FDA label includes a black box warning of serious infections and malignancy. Specifically there have been hospitalizations or death from infections such as bacterial sepsis, tuberculosis (TB), and invasive fungal (histoplasmosis) and other opportunistic infections. Additionally in children and adolescents taking golimumab, there have been lymphoma and other malignancies observed.
