It is used as an appetite suppressant and a treatment for obesity. However, due to an addictive potential, it is listed as an illicit substance in many countries. Structurally, fenproporex (N-2-cyanoethylamphetamine) falls within the phenylethamine and amphetamine chemical class of drugs. The N-2-cyanoethyl substituent was once believed to be resistant to cleavage, because fenproporex &#8212; once recommended as an obesity treatment for patients with cardiovascular disease &#8212; was originally claimed to lack stimulant properties. Contrary to the claim, research has demonstrated easy in vivo cleavage of the N-2-cyanothyl substituent to yield amphetamine as a metabolite. <sup class="footnote" id="fnr5"><a href="#fn5">5</a></sup> However, in clinical practice, central nervous system stimulative effects are less notorious than with some other agents such as diethylpropion and mazindol. <sup class="footnote" id="fnr7"><a href="#fn7">7</a></sup></p>
<p>In the United States fenproporex was never approved by the <span class="caps">FDA</span> for clinical use due to a lack of efficacy and safety data, and is listed as a drug in Schedule IV of the Controlled Substances Act. In 2006 and 2009, the <span class="caps">FDA</span> issued warnings that it had been detected in diet pills sold online, and imported from foreign manufacturers. It is also listed as a prohibited substance by the World Anti-Doping Agency. [Wikipedia]</p>
<p>Despite being banned in the United States, fenproporex has been described as the second most commonly consumed appetite suppressant worldwide, <sup class="footnote" id="fnr6"><a href="#fn6">6</a></sup> with fenproporex containing anorectics still being commonly prescribed in South America. Little is known about the specific hazards of amphetamine based diet pills, however case reports have noted side effects such as chest pain, palpitations, headaches, and insomnia. In addition, placebo controlled studies have shown that participants using fenproporex experience more joint pain, sweating, blurred vision and tremor. <sup class="footnote" id="fnr2"><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup></p></td></tr><tr><th>Structure</th><td><div class="structure"><a class="moldbi-thumbnail" href="http://structures.wishartlab.com/molecules/DB01550/image.png"><img alt="Thumb" src="http://structures.wishartlab.com/molecules/DB01550/thumb.png"></a></div><div class="structure-links"><div class="btn-group btn-group-xs"><a class="btn btn-default" href="/structures/structures/small_molecule_drugs/DB01550.mol">MOL</a><a class="btn btn-default" href="/structures/structures/small_molecule_drugs/DB01550.sdf">SDF</a><a class="btn btn-default" href="/structures/structures/small_molecule_drugs/DB01550.pdb">PDB</a><a class="btn btn-default" href="/structures/structures/small_molecule_drugs/DB01550.smiles">SMILES</a><a class="btn btn-default" href="/structures/structures/small_molecule_drugs/DB01550.inchi">InChI</a><a class="btn btn-info" href="/structures/structures/small_molecule_drugs/DB01550">View Structure</a></div></div></td></tr><tr><th>Synonyms</th><td class="data-table-container"><table class="table table-condensed table-striped datatable" id="synonyms"><thead><th>Synonym</th><th>Language</th><th>Code</th></thead><tbody><tr><td>Perphoxene</td><td><span class="wishart wishart-not-available">Not Available</span></td><td><span class="wishart wishart-not-available">Not Available</span></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><th>Salts</th><td><span class="wishart wishart-not-available">Not Available</span></td></tr><tr><th>Brand names</th><td class="data-table-container"><table class="table table-condensed table-striped datatable" id="brands"><thead><tr><th>Name</th><th>Company</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Desobesi-M</td><td>Ach&#233;</td></tr><tr><td>Feprorex</td><td>Medix</td></tr><tr><td>Lipenan</td><td>Sanofi-Aventis</td></tr><tr><td>Salcal</td><td>Saval</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><th>Brand mixtures</th><td class="data-table-container"><table class="table table-condensed table-striped datatable" id="mixtures"><thead><tr><th>Brand Name</th><th>Ingredients</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Esbelcaps </td><td>Fenproporex and Diazepam</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><th>Categories</th><td><ul><li><a href="/mesh/appetite-depressants">Appetite Depressants</a></li>

In some countries, such as Brazil, it is still prescribed -- often in the form of diet pills (ie. Brazilian Diet Pills) which combine amphetamines, benzodiazepines, antidepressants, diuretics and laxatives. 

In the United States the sale of such diet pills has been banned due to concerns over side effects, and the risk of potentially fatal overdose.
However, internet sales and illicit markets has lead to international availability. It has been found by primary care physicians that Brazilian immigrant women utilized imported diet pills at particularly high rates, and sometimes suffered from side effects requiring hospitalization or experienced a loss of employment. [3]</td></tr><tr><th>Pharmacodynamics</th><td>Fenproporex was first claimed to not exert a stimulant effect on the body, however research into its metabolism has shown that it is converted into a considerable amount of amphetamine in the body, which leads to stimulant effects. [9]</td></tr><tr><th>Mechanism of action</th><td>Fenproporex is an amphetamine based anorectic which is rapidly metabolized into amphetamine in the body. Both acute and chronic fenproporex administration has been shown to increase brain energy metabolism in young rats, by increasing the activity of citrate synthase, malate dehydrogenase, succinate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase and complexes I,II, III, and IV. [8]

Amphetamine based drugs are also known to reduce food intake. They are addictive substances due to their ability to increase dopamine release, however their anorectic effects are believed to be a result of noradrenergic neurotransmission. Activation of the alpha 1 and beta 2 adrenoceptors has been shown to decrease food intake, and drugs which release norepinephrine or block norepinephrine reuptake can activate these receptors. [3] 

The alpha 1 and beta 2 adrenoceptors are noted to be clinically important receptors in weight regulation.

Besides amphetamine, and unchanged fenproporex, 14 other metabolites were identified from urine samples. 

Two interacting metabolic pathways are believed to exist. The major pathway is believed to involve ring-degradation by aromatic hydroxylation, methylation, and side chain degradation by N-dealkyation to form amphetamine. The minor pathway involves the beta-hydroxylation of amphetamine to form norephedrine. [6]
