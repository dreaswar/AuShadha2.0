    </h1>

    <p>AuShadha (औषध): Means medicine in Sanskrit. </p>

    <p>This is a Open Source Electornic Medical Records (EMR) &amp; Public Health Management System for Small Clinics.</p>

    <p>It might be even suited for speciality medical practice after some customisation. </p>

    <p>It is developed with Python, Django and Dojo </p>

    <p>For Development the code uses sqlite3 database, but with Django DB backend we can extend this to any database ( PostgresSQL is preferred ).</p>

    <p>AuShadha code is licensed under GNU-GPL Version 3. Django, Dojo, Icons and other thrid party modules are licensed as per their authors. This should be honoured.</p>

    <h1>
      <a name="aims" class="anchor" href="#aims"><span class="mini-icon mini-icon-link"></span></a>Aims
    </h1>

    <p>There are many great Open Source EMR and Clinic Management projects, but most of them have very poor front ends. </p>

    <p>As in life, beauty and usability are key in medical practice.</p>

    <p>It is natural that more visually appealing it is more you want to use it. </p>

    <p>AuShadha will strive to achieve a balance between back and front end design. </p>

    <p>To achieve that aim Django and Dojo has been chosen. </p>

    <p>AuShadha is designed by me, a Medical Doctor in association with other Developers, so usability and practicability will always be foremost. </p>

    <p>AuShadha benefits from inputs, feature requests from my medical colleagues as the development progresses. </p>

    <h1>
      <a name="how-to-test" class="anchor" href="#how-to-test"><span class="mini-icon mini-icon-link"></span></a>How to Test
    </h1>

    <p>1) For AuShadha requirements please refer to REQUIREMENTS.txt in docs/</p>
    <p>2) AuShadha has been tested and developed with Python 2.7, Django 1.4.1 and Dojo 1.7.2 in Linux. It should work as long as dependencies are satisfied.</p>
    <p>3) Ideally create a Python Virtual Environment. If virtualenv is not installed, please run in Debian systems <code> sudo easy_install virtualenv </code></p>
    <p>4) After installing virtualenv, Create a Python Virtual Environment <code> virtualenv python_env </code></p>
    <p>5) Change the working directory to the virtualenv folder <code> cd python_env</code> and activate it <code> source bin/activate </code></p>
    <p>6) With Python pip installed, run <code> pip install -r ../docs/REQUIREMENTS.txt </code> if you are in python_env directory . This will install all the necessary dependencies you need. </p>
    <p>You may need to install Python development libraries if you are on Linux. Required to compile PIL. </p>
    <p><code>$ apt-get install python-dev #in debian systems.</code> </p>
    <p><code>$ yum install python-devel #in Redhat-like systems.</code></p>
    <p>7) cd into src/AuShadha directory <code> cd src/AuShadha </code> </p>
    <p>8) run <code> python manage.py runserver </code></p>
    <p>9) Use your browser to navigate to  http://localhost:8000/AuShadha/  . You will be greeted with a login page. Use username = admin, password = admin for a trial run.</p>
    <p>10) Please read the issues, license before using. Currently AuShadha is under active development and is not fit in anyway for real world use.</p>

      Plan
    </h1>

    <p>
      1) I plan to develop the Clinic, Patient, Physician, Nurse modules first.<br>
      2) Visit Module will be next followed by Clinical Exam, Investigations, Procedure, Discharge, Prescription<br>
      3) Stock and Pharmacy will follow.<br>
      4) Allergy and Incident Reports next<br>
      5) Admission Module will follow.<br>
      6) Specific public health modules like Paediatrics, Neonatology, Gynaecology/ Obstetrics will be last as by then
              the interdependencies will be solved
