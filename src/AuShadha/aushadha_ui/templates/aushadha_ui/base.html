       Aim
       ---
        The idea was to make AuShadha vim-like for the power user who wants to use keyboard
        The idea was to have a 'modal'UI which has a COMMAND and EDIT mode
        key_bindings allows us to access random objects with GET commands
        on key_bindings capture, by the Dojo on event system, Dialog pops up that allows easy access

       Rationale:
       ----------
         Medical applications are designed traditionally to be linear work flow ones. 
         This is completely opposite to the usual workflow in a hospital where its common
         scenario for workflow to be completely non-linear. It is tiresome to click around for this. 

         It is common to have to refer to a random note from the past while typing something for a patient. 
         As implemented in usual EMRS, it usually requires the user to leave the sceen, go elsewhere 
         and get the information.

         Keyboard events will allow the whole thing to be done with keystrokes using Dijit/Dialog

       State of Development
       --------------------
        This JS file lags behind since it was started. 
        This development will be reactivated once the core API of AuShadha is settled.

    Several Tooltips and Dialog popups are declared here. 
    To add a tooltip and bind it to a DOM node, 
    please edit the tooltips.html file

    To add a Dialog widgets edit the dialogs_and_misc.html file

    Many JS scripts use the editPatientDialog Dijit. 
    The naming was done at a time very early AuShadha's dev course. 
    Though a misnomer now, the same dialog does everything from 
    grid listing, to adding, editing and deleting items. 
    Its left there unchanged as Im too lazy to change the name :)
