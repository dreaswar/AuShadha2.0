"""
 This module houses the BaseClass for AuShadha Model and ModelForm. These inherit from
 Django models.Model class and forms.ModelForm class respectively.

 The AuShadhaBaseModel is an abstract base class that all AuShadha apps can inherit from
 Models defined throughout the app can inherit from this class.

 The AuShadhaBaseModelForm is a base class for all ModelForms which will help generate
   Dijit Form Widgets automatically. ModelForms defined throughout can inherit from it
   to autogenerate Dijit Widgets as per the dijit_fields_constants.py file definitions

    """
      Description:
      -----------

        Abstract Base AuShadha Model From which all AuShadha Models Derive.
        This has several methods that can be inherited and used throughout.

        More specifically, the generate_urls method and the self.urls variable are
        meant to be a substitute for Django's reverse method to yield the URL for
        a given object. This allows dictionary like querying in Django template to
        get the url for an object rather than use the {%url%} template tag. It is not
        any significant advantage. Just an attempt to make it a little simpler.


      Attributes Defined here:
      -------------------------

        1) self.__model_label__ --> Like the __app_label__ attribute which Django sets, this
                                    sets a label for the model. Unlike the class __name__ this is
                                    just a string.

                                    Main purpose is to allow construction of URLS for the object
                                    along with the _parent_model Attribute.


        2) self._parent_model --> Attribute that sets the parent model that the model is contained in
                                  This is almost a Zope like __contained_in__ attribute.

                                  Aside from ForeignKey which can be used to trace a model relationship back,
                                  this explicitly sets the container-contained relationship.

                                  So there is no doubt which is the container model in case there are more than
                                  on ForeignKey relationship.This allows construction of URLS by the generate_urls method.


        3) self.urls --> A Dictionary that holds all the URLS for an object constructed at runtime
                          with all the possible actions on an object. This is an experimental attempt
                          to use this in place of Django's reverse method / the {% url %} template tag.

                          The self.save() will call the self.generate_urls() and that will set the self.urls attribute.
                          This allows the dictionaly like access from template as opposed to the a little ugly
                          {% url %} template tags with all the *args and **kwargs

                          This indirectly calls the urlgenerator_factory which does the setting of URLS as per actions
                          like 'add', 'edit', 'delete', 'json', 'summary', 'pane' etc..

                          This is far from clean / elegant as it stands now, but it works.


        4) field_list --> This Attribute helps collect the fields in the model class. It is useful for returning
                          formatted presentation of the object from formatted_obj_data method.

                          Eventually this method will be ported over to a separate Presentation class that
                          deals with only how an object is presented back as HTML / JSON / other formats.
                          The HTML will include CSS inbuilt based on default values (min, max, range, True, False etc..)

                          An early attempt at this is in visit.visit_phyexam.presentation_class.py where all the
                          exam findings are verified againts default values and appropriate CSS styles are generated
                          for HTML. This does not use template as variable comparison based on Python types are
                          difficult and range comparison does not work. This code of course can be put in views.py to help
                          generate template variables but the Class based approach for presentation seems clean.

                          The disadvantage of this is that the Designer will have to meddle with Python code / ask the developer
                          to handle that should he change the CSS style / attributes later. For this purpose a template based
                          approach stub has been started in the Presentation class which can be expanded later.
